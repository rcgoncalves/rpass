# RPass: a password generator widget for macOS

## About
*RPass* is a widget that generates random passwords.
It allows to configure the size and whether we want to include non-alphanumeric characters or not.

This widget works completely offline (i.e., it does not obtain the password from a web service, or otherwise communicates with external services).
